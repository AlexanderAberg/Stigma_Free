        <h2>Trihonmoniasis</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a parasite called Trichomonas
          vaginalis (TV).
          Symptoms of trichomoniasis usually develop within a month of infection.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>
          richomoniasis in women can cause abnormal vaginal discharge that may be thick, thin or frothy
          and yellow-green in colour, producing more discharge than normal, which may also have an
          unpleasant fishy smell, soreness, swelling and itching around the vagina.
          Sometimes the inner thighs also become itchy, pain or discomfort when passing urine or having
          sex.
          Trichomoniasis in men can cause pain when peeing or during ejaculation, needing to pee more
          frequently than usual, thin, white discharge from the penis, soreness, swelling and redness
          around the head of the penis or foreskin.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Risk of Transmission</h3>
        <p>
          The parasite is usually spread by having sex without using a condom.
          It could also be spread by sharing sex toys if you do not wash them or cover them with a new
          condom before use.
          You do not have to have many sexual partners to catch trichomoniasis.
          Anyone who's sexually active can catch it and pass it on.
          It can also be spread by kissing, hugging, sharing foodware and by toilet seats.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Contact your health clinic for testing.
          They will examine your genitals and later swab you, which later is sent to a lab, they might
          also put you on treatment before the results.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Timeframe Before Testing</h3>
        <p>
          When you notice any symptoms for an STD get tested, even if you are not sure it is
          Trichomoniasis.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>
          Is often treated with antibiotics called metronidazole which you take twice a day for 5-7 days,
          there is also a higher dose version which is less effective and higher risk for especially
          people that are pregnant or breastfeeding.
          You can get worse side effects if you drink alcohol during the treatment.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Good to Know</h3>
        <p>
          The treatment often make you sick and gives a metallic taste in your mouth.
        </p>

        <h3>Vaccines</h3>
        <p>
          There is currently no vaccine against Trichomoniasis that works.
