        <h2>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that weakens the body's immune system and was
          discovered around 1980.
          Today, most of the people who are HIV positive in Sweden have access to good and effective
          treatment, but HIV still cannot be cured.
          Despite improved treatment options, there are many medical and personal consequences of living
          with HIV.
          If you do not know your HIV status, it is a good idea to get regularly tested, get treatment, if
          needed, and stop the risk of you transmitting the virus to someone else.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>
          About half of everyone who contracts HIV will develop a primary infection between one to four
          weeks after being infected.
          A primary infection means that you get sick, some people do not get very sick while others have
          strong symptoms, like a bad flu, and need to seek emergency care.
          After a couple of weeks, the primary infection subsides, but the lymph nodes are usually still
          swollen.
          Often, you can get tested for HIV during the primary infection.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Risk of Transmission</h3>
        <p>
          HIV is most commonly transmitted through unprotected anal and vaginal intercourse and through
          sharing needles.
          It can also be transmitted from birth parent to child; HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding
          people who are not receiving treatment can transmit the infection to the child.
          Oral sex carries a small risk of transferring HIV.
          Compared to many other diseases, HIV is not very easily transmitted as the virus cannot survive
          in the air.
          In order for HIV to be transmitted between people, it requires a certain level of the virus to
          be present, so if you are HIV positive and have an effective treatment, you will have an
          insufficient level of the virus in your body to transmit it to someone else.
          Most people that contract HIV are infected by someone who does not know that they have HIV.
          The best way to avoid HIV being transmitted is to use condoms when having intercourse, not let
          your mouth come in contact with sperm, and not share needles.
          Everyone shares the responsibility to protect ourselves and others, regardless of whether we are
          living with HIV or not.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>
          If you have sex in ways that HIV can be transmitted, it is a good idea to get regularly tested,
          at least once a year.
          If you are having sex with multiple partners, you should get tested every six months.
          If you are worried that you might have contracted HIV, you should get tested immediately.
          A positive test result means that you have HIV, and a negative means that you do not.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Timeframe Before Testing</h3>
        <p>
        It takes about a week from the time you last had sex that involved a risk of transmission before you can get a definite answer to a Chlamydia test.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>
          There are very effective treatments that prevent the HIV positive person from getting sick, but
          unfortunately the disease cannot be cured.
          Many who test positive start treatment quickly, often within a couple of weeks. The medications
          have improved and the adverse effects have been reduced dramatically.
          It is still common to experience side effects in the beginning of treatment, but they usually
          subside.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Good to Know</h3>
        <p>
          Most people who have HIV can live long and feel well.
          Most have undetectable viral loads, making it impossible to transmit HIV to someone else.
          Rapid HIV tests are relatively new in Sweden, and are not yet readily available in general
          healthcare. A rapid test is taken through pricking a finger and testing a few drops of blood.
          Results are usually ready within 15 minutes.
          Just like with traditional testing, you are referred to an HIV specialist.
          You can get a rapid test at RFSL or some of the other independent clinics in the larger cities.
          If you test positive at RFSL, you will get assistance in contacting healthcare, but if you test
          positive abroad then will have to contact an HIV specialist yourself.
          If you test positive in a rapid test, an additional traditional blood test is taken.
        </p>

        <h3>Vaccines</h3>
        <p>
        There is currently no vaccine against HIV.
