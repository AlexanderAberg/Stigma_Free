        <h2>Human Papillomavirus (HPV)</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          HPV comes in many variants and is common. Many types of HPV heal on their own without leaving any traces
          behind. A majority of everyone with an active sex life will get HPV at some point in their lives. Some types
          of HPV can lead to genital warts, also known as condylomas.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>
          There are over 150 different types of HPV and about 30 of them can infect the genitals, anus and tonsils. If
          you get condyloma and have a penis, the warts are usually on the foreskin, the glans or the shaft, but they
          can also be in the opening of the urethra. If you have a vagina, warts can be on the labia, around the urethra
          and in the vaginal entrance. They can also sit further into the vagina and on the cervix and can then be
          difficult to detect. You can also get warts in and around the anus. HPV can be transmitted to the mouth and
          throat. The warts can hurt, but usually they cause no discomfort. Most types of HPV virus do not cause visible
          warts. These types of HPV can cause cell changes on and in the cervix, in the anus and in the throat, which
          can eventually lead to cancer.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Risk of Transmission</h3>
        <p>
          HPV is transmitted through sex and other physical contact.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the time, testing for HPV is done by looking for warts. HPV that does not cause genital warts is
          difficult to test for. Everyone who has a female social security number and is between the ages of 23 and 60
          is regularly called for a pap smear. A pap smear involves taking a sample with a small brush from the cervix
          at the innermost part of the vagina, which is then analyzed to be able to detect and treat any cell changes in
          time before they develop into cancer.
        </p>

        <h3>Timeframe Before Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the time, testing for HPV is done by looking for warts. HPV that does not cause genital warts is
          difficult to test for. Everyone who has a female social security number and is between the ages of 23 and 60
          is regularly called for a pap smear. A pap smear involves taking a sample with a small brush from the cervix
          at the innermost part of the vagina, which is then analyzed to be able to detect and treat any cell changes in
          time before they develop into cancer.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>
          Condyloma warts usually disappear on their own after a few months and usually do not need to be treated. If
          they cause discomfort, they can sometimes be treated with a solution or cream that is applied to the warts.
          The warts can also be removed surgically. But the HPV infection in general can't be treated.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Good to Know</h3>
        <p>
          HPV virus can be transmitted from vagina to vagina. That’s why it’s important that everyone with a vagina,
          even those who have never had sex with people with a penis, go for regular pap smear. If you have a vagina but
          are a legal man, you will not receive invitations to take a pap smear, and you must therefore remember to book
          an appointment for this yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>Vaccines</h3>
        <p>
          There are vaccines against the HPV types that can cause cell changes and those that cause condyloma. Since
          2020, a vaccine has been offered to all children in 5th grade within the general vaccination program for
          children. The vaccine is most effective if you get it before you start having sex with others.
