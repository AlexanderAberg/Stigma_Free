                <h2>Chlamydia</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
<p>Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection in Sweden. A chlamydia infection rarely causes any symptoms and half of those who get chlamydia do not notice it.
</p>
<p><h3>Symptoms</h3>
If you get symptoms, they vary depending on where the infection is. If it is in the penis/vagina, you may experience discharge and/or pain when you urinate. If you have Chlamydia in your anus, you can get discharges from there. Chlamydia in the throat can cause similar symptoms to strep throat and is difficult to pass on, and usually it heals on its own.
</p>

<p><h3>Risk of Transmission</h3>Chlamydia is easily transmitted through mucous membranes and body fluids. The mucous membrane is found on the glans on the penis, in the vagina, the anus and in the mouth, and that is where you can get chlamydia. Chlamydia is transmitted most easily during vaginal and anal sex, but also during oral sex with a penis. The risk of transmitting chlamydia to the throat during oral sex with a vagina or anus is small, even without protection. There is a small risk of Chlamydia being transmitted via hands or sex toys between different peoples genitals and the anus. By avoiding transferring bodily fluids from one person to another, for example by washing hands and changing condoms on sex toys, the risk of this is reduced.
</p>

<p><h3>Testing</h3>Testing should be done on the parts of the body where you had sex. Tests for Chlamydia in the penis is usually taken with a urine sample, for people with a vagina, a urine sample is combined with sampling with a cotton swab in the vagina. Samples in the throat and anus are also taken with a swab. The sampling takes a couple of seconds.
</p>

<p><h3>Timeframe Before Testing</h3>It takes about a week from the time you last had sex that involved a risk of transmission before you can get a definite answer to a Chlamydia test.
</p>

<p><h3>Treatment</h3>Chlamydia is treated with a course of antibiotic tablets, usually for nine days.
</p>

<p><h3>Good to Know</h3>An ongoing Chlamydia infection without symptoms can cause damage to fallopian tubes or testicles, which can make it more difficult to have biological children and can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy.
</p>

<p><h3>Vaccines</h3>There is currently no vaccine against Chlamydia.</p>
